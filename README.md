# Textbook
Fundamentals of Geophysics, 3rd edition by Lowrie and Fichtner. 
 
#Learning Objectives:
By the end of the course, students will demonstrate the ability to:
1. Explain the basic theoretical foundations underlying geophysical phenomena including seismic wave generation and propagation, the Earthâ€™s magnetic, gravity, and electrical fields, heat and heat flow, buoyancy and density of Earth materials, plate tectonics on the Earth.

2. Analyze selected Earth imaging problems and predict qualitative and quantitative effects of subsurface features on measurable physical properties including seismic and electromagnetic waves, the gravity and magnetic fields, and applied and natural electrical potentials and currents.

3. Use geophysical methods to determine Earth structure, and write clear technical reports that present data, present and discuss its analysis, including uncertainties, and draw conclusions about the results.
